4️⃣ Final answer to the big question
“Why terminate at sum == 0 instead of sum == 0 && idx == 0?”

Because for non-negative arrays:

sum == 0 is a terminal truth, not a checkpoint.

And DP relies on:

States with the same meaning must return the same value.

(sum=0, idx=100) and (sum=0, idx=1) mean the same thing:

“A valid subset already exists.”
